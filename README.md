# TENPACK (TensorPACK.jl)
Tensor Linear Algebra Package in Julia

This is a package that contains dense and symmetry conserving tensor operations for the DMRjulia library. This is a dependency of that library.  Check it out here: https://github.com/bakerte/DMRJtensor.jl

As of `v0.6.0` there is now full documentation for all functions! Typing `?` followed by a function name will give documentation on most functions.
