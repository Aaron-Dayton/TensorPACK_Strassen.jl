# TENPACK (TensorPACK.jl)
Tensor Linear Algebra Package in Julia

This is a package that contains dense and symmetry conserving tensor operations for the DMRjulia library. This is a dependency of that library.  Check it out here: https://github.com/bakerte/DMRJtensor.jl

Troubleshooting: bakerte@uvic.ca

As of TENPACK `v0.8.0` there is now full (and complete) documentation for all functions! Typing `?` followed by a function name will give documentation on most functions.

We are currently beta-testing `v1.0`. Please feel free to send any critiques or comments so we can incorporate them before the initial launch.
